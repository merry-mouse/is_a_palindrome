# is_a_palindrome
Very easy Python code that store a str input and checks if it is a palindrome or not
This program asks the user to print a string and stores the input at "string_to_check" variable. 
Then it creates a new variable where it reads the stored input backwards and saves it into "reverse" and checks if it equals to initial input.
If yes, the user gets "Your string {string} is a palindrome!" message and "Your string {string} is not a palindrome!" if it's not.
